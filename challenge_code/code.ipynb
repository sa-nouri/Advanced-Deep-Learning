    "There exists several ways to balance the number of smaples in each classes. As mentioned before, there exists severe imbalance between the classes. As shown above, Most machine learning techniques will ignore the minority class, and thus, perform poorly on the observations we are most interested in. Typical challenges are biased predictions and appropriate selection of score type. There are multiple approaches to address data imbalance and the approaches could primarily focus on random over/undersampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for tabular data. I am going to explain and use SMOTE method for augmenting data.\n",
